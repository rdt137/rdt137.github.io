## About

Hello, my name is Roby Thomas. I am currently a 4th year Computer Science major student at the University of Minnesota.

## Projects

Here are some of the interesting projects I've worked on throughout my time as a software developer and student. I plan to continue to add to this list as I progress through my career, so stay tuned.

#### Modified merge sort using parellel processes

This was a group school assignment where we used parellel processes to more efficiently do merge sort. The modified merge sort splits into multiple ways as specified in the input file. Once split until the leaf nodes, the leaf nodes will then use insertion sort to sort the bottom layer before merging with the other child processes with the same parent. The finished work can be found on [github](https://github.com/rdt137/4061-Fall-2021-PA1).

#### Pizza Ordering Project

This project was done as part of a training bootcamp for .NET. I learned to utilize various technologies including ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework Core with Microsoft SQL Server for the database, as well as using docker and azure pipelines for deployment. Although some of the framework was provided, it was still a valuable experience in understanding the framework of a Full-Stack project. It can be found on my [github](https://github.com/rdt137/p1-pizzabox).
