## About

Hello, my name is Roby Thomas. I am currently a 4th year Computer Science major student at the University of Minnesota.

## Projects

Here are some of the interesting projects I've worked on throughout my time as a software developer.

#### Modified merge sort using parellel processes

This was a group school assignment where we used parellel processes to more efficiently do merge sort. The modified merge sort split into multiple ways as specified in the input file. Once split until the leaf nodes, the leaf nodes will than use insertion sort to sort the bottom layer before merging with the other child processes with the same parent.
The finished work can be found at my [github](https://github.com/rdt137/4061-Fall-2021/tree/master/PA%201).
